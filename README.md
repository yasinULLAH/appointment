## üíæ Data Storage

All application data, including your services, client list, and appointments, is stored in your web browser's **IndexedDB**. This means:

*   **Clearing browser data/cache can delete your AppointMe Solo data.** Be cautious when clearing site data for the domain you are using to access the file (e.g., `file:///`).
*   **Use the Export feature regularly** to back up your appointment data.

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (with CSS Variables for theming)
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
